# Self-Driving

Self Driving RC Car

Overview
-------
This is a small scale project created by 3 students at AIT. We care creating a self driving RC car that can detect stop signs and traffic light along with autopilot.
The car will be driven on a small scale track created by us for testing purposes.

Components
--------
1.Raspberry Pi 3 B,
2.Pi camera,
3.L293d motor driver,
4.Old RC car or 2 DC motors and wheels,
5.9V battery for the motors,

Dependencies 
--------
1.OpenCV
2.Keras
3.Tensorflow
4.Python

Progress 
-------
Hardware on the toy car has been assembled along with the raspberry pi. We have gotten the car to start moving forward and backward 
using python.

Object Detection program using tensorflow is currently working and we are adding our own images into the detection data set for machine learning.

We will be using keras which is a high level API to build and train our models in tensorflow.
